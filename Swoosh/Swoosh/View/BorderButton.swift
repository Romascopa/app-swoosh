     - When you override the awakeFromNib you want to call super per Apple documentation
     - Every view (UIView) UIButton inherits from UIView, and it has a layer properly. Apple engineers wrote this for us but the interface builder doesn'tm ake border width and color avialable so we have to do this programatically in this class (so we can re-use this)
